            <img id="pfp" src="pfp.jpg"> A promising, soon-to-be web developer, I am currently a student in the Digital 
            Crafts part-time web development bootcamp.<br><br><b>Early Life</b><br>I was born and raised in the island 
            of Guam, a U.S. island territory in Micronesia, in the Western Pacific.
            After graduating from high school, I set my sights on studying computer science at Georgia Tech and left
            my tiny island home for the city of Atlanta.<br>  <br><b>Finding Web Development</b><br>
            After 5 grueling years of studying, I graduated with a bachelor's in computer science.  Upon graduation, I 
            found a career in information technology as a database administrator.  I later met my wife, had a child
            and found a quiet life in the suburbs.  But something was missing... I felt a need to find a career doing 
            something that was creative and new.  Web development seemed like a perfect career path, as I already had
            knowledge in the subject and experience in an adjacent field.  I knew I would enjoy re-learning coding with
            all the advancements in web technology.  I found Digital Crafts after doing much research and reaching out 
            to some alumni.  I am looking forward to my journey and I am confident I will find a new career as a web
            developer.
